# Social_Media_Application_on_Flutter
# Flutter , Firebase , Firestore Databse

Just a Prototype in Developement.

See full description inside flutter_application_1

# NOTE
# folders ( .dart_tool , .idea , build ) and files( flutter-pligins, flutter-plugins-dependencies, flutter_application_1.iml) are not included in this repository
# So the project will not run directly after cloning it

It just contains the logic to be implemented and the UI to make such a application using Flutter and Firebase.
